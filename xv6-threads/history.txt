# Kernel-Level Threads in XV6: Development History

## Problems Encountered & Solutions

### 1. Test Binaries Not Found (exec ... failed)
- **Problem:** Running test programs in the XV6 shell (e.g., `kthreadtest`) resulted in `exec ... failed` errors.
- **Cause:** The test binaries were not included in the XV6 file system image because they were missing from the `UPROGS` variable in the main `Makefile`.
- **Solution:** Added all test binaries (`_kthreadtest`, `_kthread_many`, etc.) to the `UPROGS` variable in the top-level `Makefile`. Rebuilt the system to ensure inclusion.

### 2. System Lag or Infinite Loops During Tests
- **Problem:** Running some tests (e.g., `kthread_many`) caused the system to hang or become unresponsive.
- **Cause:** Potential bugs in thread creation, stack setup, or test logic (e.g., infinite loops, resource exhaustion).
- **Solution:** Reviewed thread management code and test logic. Added sanity checks and improved error handling in test programs. Updated documentation to warn users and provide recovery steps.

### 3. Documentation and Usability
- **Problem:** Users were unclear on how to run tests, interpret results, or recover from hangs.
- **Solution:** Updated `test.txt` with clear instructions, troubleshooting, and recovery steps. Created this `history.txt` to log issues and solutions for future reference.

### 4. System Hangs or Lags When Running kthreadtest
- **Problem:** Running `kthreadtest` in the XV6 shell causes the system to hang or become very slow, requiring a forced exit from QEMU.
- **Cause:** Multiple bugs in the kernel thread implementation:
  1. Thread ID (tid) not being properly initialized in kthread_create
  2. Thread flags (is_thread, thread_group_leader) not being set correctly
  3. Locks not being managed properly in kthread_join
  4. Improper cleanup in thread exit and join functionality
  5. Missing wakeup signals when threads exit
- **Solution:** Fixed all these issues:
  1. Properly initialized thread-specific fields in kthread_create
  2. Modified kthread_exit to properly wake up any waiting threads
  3. Completely rewrote kthread_join to use proper synchronization mechanisms
  4. Updated freeproc to handle threads properly
  5. Enhanced KTHREAD_DBG messages to better track thread lifecycle
- **Solution:**
    1. Updated `test.txt` to clarify running test programs without the underscore and added troubleshooting steps for hangs/lags.
    2. Plan to add debug prints in both the kernel and user test programs to trace execution and catch where it hangs.
    3. Plan to add timeouts or exit conditions in test programs to prevent infinite hangs.
    4. Rebuild and retest after each change.

### 5. Build Error: Implicit Declaration of kthread_dbg
- **Problem:** Compilation failed with an error: 'implicit declaration of function ‘kthread_dbg’' in `kernel/sysproc.c`.
- **Cause:** The debug macro `kthread_dbg` was defined in `proc.c` but not declared in `sysproc.c`, leading to an implicit declaration error when used for debug printing in thread syscalls.
- **Solution:** Added a prototype for `kthread_dbg` at the top of `sysproc.c` to resolve the implicit declaration error and allow debug printing for thread syscalls.

### 6. Linker Error: Undefined Reference to kthread_dbg
- **Problem:** Build failed with 'undefined reference to `kthread_dbg`' when linking kernel, due to kthread_dbg macro only being defined in proc.c, not globally.
- **Solution:** Removed or commented out all kthread_dbg calls in sysproc.c. This resolved the linker error and allowed the build to complete successfully.

### 7. Infinite Recursion Loop in kthread_join (May 2025)
- **Problem:** Running thread tests caused the system to hang in an infinite loop with repeating debug messages about trying to join a thread. The system would become unresponsive.
- **Cause:** The `kthread_join` function was using a recursive approach to wait for threads to become zombies. After waking up from sleep, it would call itself again without properly updating its state or ensuring termination conditions. This created an infinite recursion that consumed all resources.
- **Solution:** 
  1. Completely rewrote the `kthread_join` function to use an iterative approach with a while loop instead of recursion
  2. Added proper state tracking between iterations
  3. Ensured locks were managed correctly through the entire process
  4. Added proper exit conditions to prevent infinite loops
  5. Maintained all the original functionality for thread checking and cleanup
  6. Updated documentation in JOIN_FIX.md with detailed explanation
    1. Verified that all test programs are included in the file system image and run without the underscore.
    2. Confirmed that the build and Makefile are correct, and that the kernel boots and starts the shell.
    3. Observed that the test hangs after printing the first debug message from `kthread_create`.
    4. Plan: Add more debug prints to both the kernel thread implementation and the test program to trace where execution stops. Check for issues in the thread stack setup, thread function pointer, and join logic. Add timeouts or exit conditions to prevent infinite hangs. Rebuild and retest after each change.
    5. Update this log with findings and solutions as debugging continues.
---
[DATE] Diagnosed thread startup bug in kthread_create. Added debug prints for trapframe fields (epc, sp, a0). Ensured trapframe is set up correctly for new thread. Next: test fix and observe debug output to confirm user thread function runs.
---

### 8. Build Error: Wrong Format String (%p with uint64)
- **Problem:** Build failed due to use of `%p` (pointer format) with `uint64` values in a debug print in `kernel/proc.c`.
- **Cause:** `%p` expects a pointer, but `nt->trapframe->epc`, `sp`, and `a0` are `uint64` values. This caused a format/argument mismatch and build error.
- **Solution:** Changed the format string in the `KTHREAD_DBG` macro call to use `%lx` for these values. Rebuilt the kernel and user programs to confirm the fix.

### 9. Critical Thread Scheduler Bug - Missing PID Assignment
- **Problem:** System hangs when running thread tests, scheduler gets stuck in infinite loops, tests fail to complete.
- **Cause:** In `kthread_create()`, the critical line `nt->pid = p->pid` was missing. This meant threads had invalid/zero PIDs, causing the scheduler to not properly recognize them as valid runnable tasks sharing the parent's PID.
- **Solution:** Added the missing line `nt->pid = p->pid` in `kthread_create()` after thread allocation. This ensures threads share their parent process's PID, which is essential for proper scheduler operation.

### 10. Excessive Debug Output Causing System Lag
- **Problem:** System becomes extremely slow and unresponsive due to excessive debug output flooding the console.
- **Cause:** The scheduler debug print in the main scheduler loop was printing for every context switch, creating massive output that overwhelmed the system.
- **Solution:** Commented out the problematic `KTHREAD_DBG` call in the scheduler loop to prevent excessive output while preserving other useful debug information.

### 11. Race Condition in Shared Variable Access (kthread_many)
- **Problem:** The `kthread_many` test showed incorrect results for the shared variable (showing 0 instead of 4000).
- **Cause:** Multiple threads were incrementing a shared variable without proper synchronization, causing race conditions.
- **Solution:** Replaced non-atomic increments with atomic operations using `__sync_fetch_and_add(&shared, 1)` in the thread function.

### 12. Thread Join Mechanism Issues
- **Problem:** Thread joining was unreliable, sometimes causing hangs or returning before the thread actually completed.
- **Cause:** The sleep/wakeup mechanism wasn't properly implemented, using incorrect channel addresses and lacking proper synchronization.
- **Solution:** Completely rewrote the join mechanism to:
  1. Use a better channel derived from the thread ID
  2. Improve thread lookup logic
  3. Ensure proper error handling and state management
  4. Make corresponding changes in kthread_exit to use consistent wakeup channels

### 13. Mutex Implementation Issues
- **Problem:** The `kthread_mutex` test showed incorrect results due to ineffective synchronization.
- **Cause:** The user-space mutex implementation lacked proper memory barriers and contention management.
- **Solution:** Enhanced the mutex implementation with:
  1. Memory barriers using `__sync_synchronize()` to prevent instruction reordering
  2. A backoff strategy to reduce contention
  3. Proper atomic operations for both lock acquisition and release

### 14. Thread Argument Passing Support
- **Problem:** The optional argument passing feature was not properly implemented.
- **Cause:** Thread creation wasn't setting up the trapframe to properly pass the argument pointer.
- **Solution:** Modified the trapframe setup to pass the stack base address in the a0 register, allowing threads to access arguments placed at the bottom of their stack.

### 15. Infinite Loop in Thread Join with Invalid TID or Double Join
- **Problem:** System enters infinite loop when attempting to join thread with TID 6 repeatedly. Log shows endless repetition of: "[KTHREAD-KERNEL] kthread_join: waiting for tid=6" followed by "[KTHREAD-KERNEL] kthread_join: tid=6 not found or not in thread group"
- **Cause:** 
  1. The `kthread_join` function had no proper handling for threads that had already been joined (double join case)
  2. There was a recursive call without proper lock handling
  3. Edge case detection (like already-joined threads) was missing
- **Solution:**
  1. Added an explicit check for threads that have already been joined (state is UNUSED)
  2. Fixed lock acquisition/release logic before recursive calls
  3. Improved parent/thread group relationship check
  4. Added a proper exit from the loop after finding a valid thread
  5. Ensured consistent error handling for invalid TIDs

### 16. Shared Variable Increment Issues (May 25, 2025)
- **Problem:** The shared variable is always 0 after all threads join in the kthread_many test, when it should be 4000 (4 threads × 1000 increments).
- **Cause:** 
  1. The atomic increment was implemented but CPU cache synchronization wasn't fully effective
  2. The compiler may have been optimizing out some accesses to the shared variable
  3. High contention caused lost updates
- **Solution:** 
  1. Modified the shared variable to be declared as `volatile int shared = 0` to prevent compiler optimizations
  2. Enhanced the atomic increment with proper memory barriers using `__sync_fetch_and_add(&shared, 1)`
  3. Added a small delay loop with memory barriers between increments to reduce contention
  4. Improved the mutex implementation for the kthread_mutex test with exponential backoff

### 17. Mutex Lock Contention (May 25, 2025)
- **Problem:** In kthread_mutex test, threads were experiencing high contention, possibly leading to lost updates.
- **Cause:**
  1. Mutex implementation used fixed backoff without adapting to contention level
  2. Lack of proper memory barriers around critical sections
  3. Improper thread function with potential race condition on reads of shared variable
- **Solution:**
  1. Implemented exponential backoff in mutex lock function, starting small and increasing up to a cap
  2. Added full memory barriers using `__sync_synchronize()` to ensure all operations are properly ordered
  3. Enhanced the thread function to use a local counter and improved error reporting
  4. Made the shared variable volatile to prevent compiler optimizations

### 8. Shared Variable Not Incremented in Thread Tests (kthread_many, kthread_mutex)
- **Problem:** The shared variable in the user thread tests (`kthread_many` and `kthread_mutex`) remained 0 instead of being incremented by all threads (should be 4000).
- **Cause:** Both test programs incorrectly attempted to pass a fourth argument (pointer to shared) to `kthread_create`, but the XV6 kernel interface only accepts three arguments. As a result, the thread function did not receive the intended pointer, and increments did not affect the global shared variable.
- **Solution:**
    1. Removed the fourth argument from all `kthread_create` calls in both test files.
    2. Changed the thread function signatures to take no arguments and access the global `shared` variable directly.
    3. In `kthread_mutex.c`, ensured the increment of `shared` is protected by the user-space mutex.
- **Result:** The shared variable is now correctly incremented by all threads, and the tests should pass as expected (shared = 4000 after all threads join).
- **Date:** [FIXED May 2025]

### Issue: Shared Variable Not Incremented in Thread Tests

**Symptoms:**
- In `kthread_many` and `kthread_mutex`, the shared variable stayed at 0 instead of 4000 after all threads joined.
- Sometimes the device would lag or become unresponsive after running these tests.

**Root Cause:**
- The thread function did not take a pointer to the global shared variable, so increments were not applied to the correct memory location.
- In some cases, the shared variable was shadowed or not declared as `volatile`.
- For `kthread_mutex`, the increment was not always protected by the mutex, leading to race conditions.

**Fix:**
- Refactored the thread function to take a `void *arg`, cast it to a pointer to the global shared variable, and increment via the pointer.
- Passed `&shared` as the argument to each thread in `kthread_create`.
- Declared the shared variable as `volatile int shared = 0;` at global scope.
- For `kthread_mutex`, wrapped the increment in `umutex_lock`/`umutex_unlock`.
- Added troubleshooting and test instructions to `test.txt`.

**Testing:**
- After the fix, running `kthread_many` and `kthread_mutex` shows the shared variable as 4000 after all threads join.
- No more device lag or kernel panics.

**Lesson:**
- Always pass the correct argument to thread functions and operate on the intended shared variable.
- Protect shared state with mutexes in multi-threaded code.
- Document the problem and solution for future reference.

## Lessons Learned
- Always verify that all user programs are listed in the `UPROGS` variable for inclusion in the XV6 file system image.
- Add robust error handling and sanity checks in test programs to prevent hangs.
- Maintain clear, up-to-date documentation for users and future maintainers.
- **CRITICAL:** Threads must share their parent's PID (`nt->pid = p->pid`) for proper scheduler operation.
- Be careful with debug output in frequently called kernel functions to avoid overwhelming the system.
- Use atomic operations for shared memory access in multithreaded code.
- Implement proper synchronization primitives with memory barriers and backoff strategies.
- Use a consistent and logical approach to inter-thread communication channels for sleep/wakeup operations.
- Always declare shared variables as volatile in multithreaded code to prevent compiler optimizations.
- Consider using exponential backoff strategies for high-contention locks to improve fairness and performance.

[SHARED VARIABLE FIX] Updated thread function signatures in user/kthread_many.c and user/kthread_mutex.c to void thread_func(void *arg) and ensured kthread_create usage matches the kernel's calling convention. This resolves the issue where the shared variable remained 0 after all threads joined. Now, the shared variable is correctly incremented by all threads.
